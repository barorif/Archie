# Algorithms

The notion of an *algorithm* is basic to all of computer programming, so we should begin with a careful analysis of this concept. ...

By 1950, the word algorithm was most frequently associated with Euclid's algorithm, a process for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers that appears in Euclid's _Elements_ (Book 7, Propositions 1 and 2). It will be instructive to exhibit Euclid's algorithm here:

**Algorithm E** (Euclid's algorithm). Given two positive integers _m_ and _n_, find their _greatest common divisor_, that is, the largest positive integer that evently divides both _m_ and _n_.

1. [Find remainder.] Divide _m_ by _n_ and let _r_ by the remainder. (We will have 0 ≤ _r_ ≤ _n_.)
2. [Is it zero?] If _r_ = 0, the algorithm terminates; _n_ is the answer.
3. [Reduce.] Set _m_ ← _n_, _n_ ← _r_, and go back to step 1.

Of course, Euclid did not present his algorithm in just this manner. The format above illustrates the style in which all of the algorithms throughout this book will be presented.
